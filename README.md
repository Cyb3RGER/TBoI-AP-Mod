# TBoI AP Mod
This a Mod for [The Binding of Isaac Repentance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/) that provides Integration for [Arichpelago Multi World](https://archipelago.gg)

To connect to a game configure the ``connection_info.lua`` inside the mod folder with appropriate AP host address and port as well as your slot name and the AP server password if needed. After filling in the connection details you have to restart the game and can now start a new run.

__This mod requires the ``--luadebug`` launch option to be set to work. Please inform yourself about the security risk that come with setting the ``--luadebug`` launch option.__
