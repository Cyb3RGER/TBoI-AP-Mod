# ToDo 
## Repentogon rewrite:
- [x] implement stage unlocks
- [ ] new location split options
  - [ ] change when items transform to AP items
  - [x] change how locations are sent
  - [ ] implement ui showing location counts and unlocked stages (either in ImGui or native; worst case this has to be a PopTracker pack)
- [ ] add console commands?
- [ ] add AP UI element in ImGui for better TextInput
- [ ] new QoL features
  - [ ] make force pickup an option (similar to cooliojazz's fork)
  - [ ] disabled death link option
  - [ ] ...


## Maybe Later:
- [ ] look into other AP features
  - [ ] gifting
  - [ ] energy link
  - [ ] item link (?)
  - [ ] dynamic filler items (?)
- [ ] look into reruns
  - [ ] -> counts as old seed cause isContinued + new seed (?)
